How to play - The goal is to create a pathway to the final room by pulling levers to rearrange the bookshelves. However, a wizard patrols the library. If he spots you, he will begin chasing you. If you move out of sight of the wizard or hide under a table, be will stop chasing you. If the wizard touches you, it is game over and you must restart the level.
controls- Shift to run. Use the WASD keys to move around and the mouse to move the camera. Use E to hide under/exit the table. Use E on the lever to activate the moving wall.
